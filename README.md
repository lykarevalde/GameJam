# Be My Friend

## Game Description
Be My Friend is a 2D game where you play as a friendly ghost haunting a school after hours.
Instead of scaring students away, your goal is to befriend them by possessing objects and turning fear into fun.
Enemy ghosts lurk in the halls, trying to frighten students for their own amusement. Outsmart them, protect the students, and prove that not all ghosts want to haunt.
